### Neural Net Number Reader

This is my first attempt at a neural net that I built using the theories explained in [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html) by Michael Nielson. I implemented this network myself using a single 3rd party linear algebra library. I used Nielson's python implementation as guide on how best to apply the linear algebra operations. 

This implementation is slow and has a relatively low accuracy (%85). After completing this, I used what I had learned to produce a new network that is much more performant and accurate (it also only uses the Java Standard Libraries). You can see it [here](https://github.com/reggiemcdonald/new-neural-net-number-reader).
